\title{Create a subquery barrier without executing}
\usage{
\method{collapse}{tbl_gpu}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tbl_gpu} object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_gpu} with a barrier marker in its lazy_ops.
}
\description{
Marks the current point in the pipeline as an optimization barrier.
Operations before and after the barrier are optimized separately.
Does not execute anything until \code{collect()} or \code{compute()} is called.
}
\details{
Use \code{collapse()} when you want to prevent certain optimizations from
crossing a boundary (e.g., prevent filter pushdown past a certain point).

In eager mode, \code{collapse()} is a no-op.
