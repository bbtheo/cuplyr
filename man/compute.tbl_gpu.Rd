\title{Force computation of pending GPU operations}
\usage{
\method{compute}{tbl_gpu}(x, ..., name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tbl_gpu} object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused, for compatibility).}

\item{name}{Ignored (included for dplyr compatibility).}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_gpu} with all operations materialized and \code{lazy_ops} cleared.
}
\description{
Executes any pending lazy operations and stores the result in a new GPU
table. Data remains on the GPU (unlike \code{collect()} which transfers to R).
}
\details{
Use \code{compute()} when you want to:
\itemize{
\item Force optimization and execution of a lazy pipeline
\item Create a checkpoint before branching operations
\item Free memory from intermediate tables
\item Prepare data for non-cuplyr functions that need a materialized table
}

In eager mode, \code{compute()} is a no-op since operations execute immediately.
}
\examples{
if (has_gpu()) {
  # Lazy pipeline
  lazy_result <- tbl_gpu(mtcars, lazy = TRUE) |>
    filter(mpg > 20) |>
    mutate(kpl = mpg * 0.425)

  # Force execution, keep on GPU
  gpu_result <- lazy_result |> compute()

  # Now branch into two different analyses
  analysis1 <- gpu_result |> filter(cyl == 4) |> collect()
  analysis2 <- gpu_result |> filter(cyl == 6) |> collect()
}
}

\code{\link{collect.tbl_gpu}} to bring data back to R,
\code{\link{collapse.tbl_gpu}} to add optimization barrier without executing
